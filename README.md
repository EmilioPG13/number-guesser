# Number Guesser Project

This is my project for the Codecademy course. I am building a small guessing game using JavaScript functions. The code will run in the browser and I can use the browser's console to test my functions and view any syntax errors.

## Project Requirements

In this project, I will write four functions in `script.js`. The provided JavaScript code in `game.js` will call my functions based on user interactions, so I don't need to look at or edit `game.js`. I will make sure to name my functions exactly as specified within the tasks so that they can be called correctly during the game.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to write JavaScript functions to power the number guessing game. The game will include features like generating a target value, comparing guesses, updating scores, and advancing rounds.

For more details and to see the completed version of the project, I can visit the [completed version](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/number-guesser/example/index.html).

## Additional Information

The selection contains additional JavaScript and CSS code used in the project. It includes the HTML structure, event listeners, and styling for the game interface.

I will refer to the provided code and the project requirements in `script.js` to understand how the game functions and how I can complete the project.

Good luck with my project!
